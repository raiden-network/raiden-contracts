        // more difficult: attention to overflows and underflows, that MUST be
        // handled without throwing.

        // Cases that require attention:
        // case1. If participant1 does NOT provide a balance proof or provides
        // an old balance proof.  participant2_transferred_amount can be [0,
        // real_participant2_transferred_amount) We MUST NOT punish
        // participant2.
        // case2. If participant2 does NOT provide a balance proof or provides
        // an old balance proof.  participant1_transferred_amount can be [0,
        // real_participant1_transferred_amount) We MUST NOT punish
        // participant1.
        // case3. If neither participants provide a balance proof, we just
        // subtract their withdrawn amounts from their deposits.

        // This is why, the algorithm implemented in Solidity is:
        // (explained at each step, below)
        // RmaxP1 = (T2 + L2) - (T1 + L1) + D1 - W1
