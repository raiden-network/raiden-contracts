Release Process Document
========================

Package Deliverables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- smart contracts source code from ``raiden_contracts/contracts``
- compiled contracts data from ``raiden_contracts/data/contracts.json``
- deployment information from ``raiden_contracts/data/deployment_*.json``, with Ethereum addresses, transaction data (transaction hash, block number, constructor arguments, gas cost)
- scripts for deployment & contract verification on Etherscan from ``raiden_contracts/deploy``
- source code tests from ``raiden_contracts/tests``

Package Release Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When we want to release another version of the ``raiden-contracts`` package, we need to:


#. `Check if any source code changes have been done <check-source-changes>`_. If no, skip this step. If yes:

   #. `Bump the version on the smart contracts <bump-contracts>`_
   #. `Deploy smart contracts <_deploy-contracts>`_ on all the supported chains and overwrite ``deployment_*,json`` files with the new deployment data.
   #. `Verify the deployed smart contracts on Etherscan <verify-contracts>`_

#. `Bump the package version <bump-package>`_
#. `Release the new package version <_release-package>`_

.. _check-source-changes:

Check Source Code Changes
-------------------------

First, identify the last release in `the GitHub page <https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/releases>`__ and find the corresponding tag in Git.

For a package release, source code changes imply changes in:

**Compiled Data**

The compiled data for all the contracts resides in the ``data/contracts.json`` file.

Now, we do not manually need to check if the compiled data is correct, because this check is included in our Continuous Integration testing. Any source code change forces us to recompile the contracts with ``make compile_contracts``, otherwise our CI tests will fail: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/raiden_contracts/tests/test_contracts_compilation.py. These tests check:

* if the ``contracts_version`` from ``contracts.json`` matches the current ``CONTRACTS_VERSION``
* if the ``contracts_checksums`` and ``overall_checksum`` from ``contracts.json`` matches the source code checksums, calculated in the test.

Additionally, we test whether each contract source code ``contracts_version`` matches the ``CONTRACTS_VERSION``. E.g. https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/raiden_contracts/tests/test_token_network.py#L16-L17


**Deployment Data**

Deployment data is kept in the ``data/deployment_[CHAIN_NAME].json`` files.

We **DO** need to manually check whether source code changes have been done since the last release. We should add an automatic check here before releasing (e.g. checking that the ``contracts_version`` here matches the one from ``data/contracts.json``)


.. _bump-contracts:

Bump Smart Contracts Version
----------------------------

::

    bumpversion --config-file ./.bumpversion_contracts.cfg [PART]

``[PART]`` can be ``major``, ``minor``, ``patch``.

* The script changes the version located here:
  * ``CONTRACTS_VERSION`` https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/raiden_contracts/constants.py#L4
  * each ``contract_version`` constant from each contract source. E.g. https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/raiden_contracts/contracts/TokenNetwork.sol#L14
* We are currently at a ``0.*`` version. Our first ``major`` bump will be made when a stable, not-limited version will be released on the main net.
* ``minor`` bumps (for now) are made for contract ABI changes.
* ``patch`` bumps are made for any fix that does not touch the ABI.

.. _deploy-contracts:

Deploy Smart Contracts
----------------------

Instructions for deploying the contracts can be found at https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts#deployment-on-a-testnet, using the ``python -m raiden_contracts.deploy`` script.
We currently deploy on:

* Ropsten - for all releases
* Rinkeby - for all releases
* Kovan - for all releases
* Mainnet - only for pre-major or major releases


**Checking Validity of deployment_*.json Data**

We have checks for:
- ``contracts_version``: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/raiden_contracts/deploy/__main__.py#L503
- ``chain_id``: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/raiden_contracts/deploy/__main__.py#L503
- deployment addresses & transaction data for each contract, checked against the chain we are running the script on

These checks are performed at the end of the deployment script. They can also be run independently with ``python -m raiden_contracts.deploy verify``, as described in the above link.

We also have CI tests that check whether the deployment data returned by the deployment script contains all necessary information, for all the contracts we need to deploy: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/raiden_contracts/tests/test_deploy_script.py.

.. _verify-contracts:

Etherscan Verification
----------------------

Etherscan verification is documented here: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts#verification-with-etherscan.

Note that we currently have some issues with the script: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/issues/349.


.. _bump-package:

Bump Package Version
--------------------

Before bumping the package version, ``git add`` the deployment data at ``data/deployment_[CHAIN_NAME].json``. Also make sure ``MANIFEST.in`` contains all the deployment JSON files.  Then run

::

    bumpversion --config-file ./.bumpversion.cfg [PART]

``[PART]`` can be ``major``, ``minor``, ``patch``.

* The script changes the version located here:
  * ``VERSION`` https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/setup.py#L15
* We are currently at a ``0.*`` version. Our first ``major`` bump will be made when a stable, not-limited version will be released on the main net.
* for now, ``minor`` bumps are done if ``minor`` or ``patch`` smart contract bumps are done or when we introduce backwards incompatible changes to package deliverables (e.g. changing variable names or helper functions).
* ``patch`` bumps are made for any other fix

This command triggers a commit and a local tag is created. A PR must be made with the commit changes.

.. _change-changelog:

Change the Versions of CHANGELOG.md
-----------------------------------

* Make sure all significant changes from the last release are listed.
* Turn the existing ``Unreleased`` section into a new release section.

.. _release-package:

Trigger Package Release
-----------------------

Push the newly created local tag (created at the previous step, e.g. ``v0.9.0``) directly to the ``master`` branch. This will trigger ``travis`` to upload the pypi package automatically, as seen here: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/blob/9fd2124eb648a629aee886f37ade5e502431371f/.travis.yml#L36-L47.
