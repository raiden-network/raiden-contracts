`Raiden Network Smart Contract specs`_

.. _Raiden Network Smart Contract specs: https://raiden-network-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/smart_contracts.html

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python 3.6
-  https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

Installation
------------

Recommended::

    pip install raiden-contracts


Usage
-----

We do not recommend the smart contracts to be used in production as of this moment. All contracts are WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Use at your own risk.

If you want to use the officially deployed contracts, please use the ``raiden_contracts/data_<CONTRACTS_VERSION>`` files to get the precompiled data (ABI, bytecode etc.) and addresses for initializing the contract instances.

You can find other useful constants that you can import in ``raiden_contracts/constants.py``.

.. Note::
    There are currently three versions supported in this package:

    * Development ``0.3._`` contracts version (from ``0.3.0`` package release: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/releases/tag/v0.3.0). No limits on the number of tokens registered; has a limit of 100 tokens per channel). Source code: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/tree/fc1c79329a165c738fc55c3505cf801cc79872e4/raiden_contracts/contracts
    * Red Eyes Mainnet ``0.4.0`` contracts version (from ``0.7.0`` package release: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/releases/tag/v0.7.0). Source code: https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/tree/fac73623d5b92b7c070fdde2b446648ec9117474/raiden_contracts/contracts
    * current !development version corresponding with the ``master`` branch (might not be stable).

    These are temporary and will be removed in favor of only one contracts version in the Ithaca Milestone.

If you are using the ``raiden-contracts`` package in your project, you can use::

    from raiden_contracts.contract_manager import (
        ContractManager,
        contracts_precompiled_path,
    )
    from raiden_contracts.constants import (
        CONTRACT_TOKEN_NETWORK_REGISTRY,
        CONTRACT_MONITORING_SERVICE,
        EVENT_TOKEN_NETWORK_CREATED,
    )

    # Uses the newest version. Available on Kovan, Rinkeby and Ropsten.
    # Mainnet deployments should not be accessed with contract_version == None.
    contracts_version = None

    # Uses Red Eyes, Mainnet enabled version with deposit limits.
    # The version is also available on Kovan, Rinkeby and Ropsten.
    contracts_version = '0.4.0'

    # Uses the pre-red-eyes development version, probably without
    # deposit limits. Available only on Kovan, Rinkeby and Ropsten.
    # The Solidity source of this version is unknown on Etherscan.
    # See https://github.com/raiden-network/raiden-contracts/issues/543
    contracts_version = '0.3._'

    manager = ContractManager(contracts_precompiled_path(contracts_version))
    compiled_contract_data = manager.get_contract(CONTRACT_TOKEN_NETWORK_REGISTRY)

    deployment_data = get_contracts_deployed(int(web3.version.network))
    TOKEN_NETWORK_REGISTRY_ADDRESS = deployment_data['contracts'][CONTRACT_TOKEN_NETWORK_REGISTRY].address

    # And then use:
    # compiled_contract_data['abi']
    # compiled_contract_data['bin']
    # TOKEN_NETWORK_REGISTRY_ADDRESS
    # to initialize the contract instance

    # To use one of the 3rd party services contracts:
    compiled_ms_contract = manager.get_contract(CONTRACT_MONITORING_SERVICE)
    deployed_services = get_contracts_deployed(int(web3.version.network), services=True)
    MONITORING_SERVICE_ADDRESS = deployed_services['contracts'][CONTRACT_MONITORING_SERVICE].address


All contracts under ``raiden_contracts/contracts/test/`` are only for testing purposes and they should not be used in production.

Development
-----------

If you want to test and further develop outside the officially provided source code, compiled files and deployed addresses, you can do it at your own risk.


If you want to install the package from source::

    make install

To verify that the precompiled ``raiden_contracts/data/contracts.json`` file corresponds to the source code of the contracts::

    make verify_contracts

For development and testing, you have to install additional dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt


Compile the contracts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Needed if you have made changes to the source code.
Make sure you have `solc` installed: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html

::

    make compile_contracts


Testing
^^^^^^^

If you want to write tests, check `/raiden_contracts/tests/README.md` first.

::

    # tests
    pytest
    pytest raiden_contracts/tests/test_token_network.py

    # Recommended for speed:
    pip install pytest-xdist==1.17.1
    pytest -n NUM_OF_CPUs


If you are using the ``raiden-contracts`` package in your project, you can also test the source code directly (not only the precompiled contract data)::

    from raiden_contracts.contract_manager import (
        ContractManager,
        contracts_source_path,
    )

    manager = ContractManager(contracts_source_path(<CONTRACTS_VERSION>))


Deployment on a testnet
-----------------------

- get the source code from the latest stable release
- install development dependencies::

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

.. Note::
    If deploying on your own private chain, you need to start ``geth`` with ``--networkid <chainID_from_genesis.json>``. The private chain must be running the Byzantium protocol (or a later version) at the time of deployment.

    If you want to use a particular version of the contracts that is supported, you can use the ``deploy`` script with ``-- contracts-version "0.4.0"``.

Check deployment options::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy --help

Deploying the main Raiden Network contracts with the ``raiden`` command::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy raiden --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /path/to/your/private_key/file --gas-price 10 --gas-limit 6000000

Deploying the mock token contract for paying for the services (not to be done on the mainnet)::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy token --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /path/to/your/private_key/file --gas-price 10 --token-supply 20000000 --token-name ServiceToken --token-decimals 18 --token-symbol SVT

Deploying the 3rd party service contracts with the ``services`` command::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy services --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /path/to/your/private_key/file --gas-price 10 --gas-limit 6000000 --token-address TOKEN_USED_TO_PAY_SERVICES

Deploying a token for testing purposes (please DO NOT use this for production purposes) with the ``token`` command::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy token --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /path/to/your/private_key/file --gas-price 10 --token-supply 10000000 --token-name TestToken --token-decimals 18 --token-symbol TTT

Registering a token with the ``TokenNetworkRegistry`` contract, so it can be used by the Raiden Network, with the ``register`` command::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy register --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key /path/to/your/private_key/file --gas-price 10 --token-address TOKEN_TO_BE_REGISTERED_ADDRESS --registry-address TOKEN_NETWORK_REGISTRY_ADDRESS

.. Note::
    Registering a token only works once. All subsequent transactions will fail.

Deployment information is stored in a ``deployment_[CHAIN_NAME].json`` file corresponding to the chain on which it was deployed. To verify that the deployed contracts match the compiled data in ``contracts.json`` and also match the deployment information in the file, we can run:

::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy verify --rpc-provider http://127.0.0.1:8545

    # Based on the network id, the script verifies the corresponding deployment_[CHAIN_NAME].json file
    # using the chain name-id mapping from constants.py


Verification with Etherscan
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    python -m raiden_contracts.deploy.etherscan_verify --apikey ETHERSCAN_APIKEY --chain-id 3

If the command exists with status code 0, Etherscan has verified all contracts against Solidity sources.
